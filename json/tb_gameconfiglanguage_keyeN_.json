In the village where Nadore lives, a human caravan came here. At first the elves were wary of the interesting objects the traders brought out, but with the traders' rhetoric and those interesting toys, a small group of uninitiated elves were soon attracted. \nAlthough the elders of the village strictly forbade those immature elves from contacting humans alone, the cunning humans still found a way to go door to door, giving small gifts and then saying goodbye. A small number of elves did fall for it, and they sneaked out to follow these caravans, and were subsequently captured by the caravan's traps.

The family's resources soon tilted in her favor, and Bellows received the highest quality education, and she was instilled with the concept of the Shield of Glory and the code of noble behavior at an early age. \nThanks to the open political and commercial environment of Byanis, the city attracted a great deal of talents from the world. Bellows was able to communicate fluently with the elves and northern barbarians at a very young age, thanks to her own excellent talent. At the same time, Bellows also became interested in ancient history under the influence of her elders, and she tried to secretly follow the caravan from the mysterious hills to dig up the ancient secrets of the region. But the Grand Duke of Hild was so angry that he executed some of the merchants from the caravan and restricted Bellows' freedom. \nWhen Bellows was eighteen years old, her father was wounded by a stray arrow during the territorial war with Sylvia and died shortly afterward at the Fortress of the Shield.

This time they needed to go to the other world to fight against the void creatures that were comparable to the gods. Countless heroes and races of the material world would gather, and Carville would join with them to form an unprecedented alliance to fight the invasion of the void army. \nThen, with the help of the gods, they defeated the void invasion with great difficulty, and the soldiers brought by Carville became more and more resilient, but after they defeated the extremely powerful Apostle Siru of the Void Legion, many of them contracted a strange disease after the return trip. \nWith sadness and sorrow, Carville returned to his quarters. The outbreak of the plague, the disappearance of his father and the loss of his comrades constantly hit Carville.

At the critical moment of destiny, what people need most is not to stick to rules, but a stone to break down obstacles.

(His expression could not be seen from under the huge mask.)","key":"plotlanguage3081006"},{"eN_":"...","key":"plotlanguage3081007"},{"eN_":"Oh, sorry, I forgot to change my expression (the corners of the mouth of the huge mask gradually rose, presenting a strange smiley face)","key":"plotlanguage3081008"},{"eN_":"I've heard all about you guys from Nadore, so... (The huge smiling face gradually becomes serious)","key":"plotlanguage3081009"},{"eN_":"The answers you need are at the Fountain of Eternity in the middle of the Desert of Sighs, and when you get there, you will naturally get the answers you want. Now close your eyes!","key":"plotlanguage3081010"},{"eN_":"Huh? Where is this?","key":"plotlanguage4010101"},{"eN_":"Wow, what amazing magic! It's even better than my space device!","key":"plotlanguage4010102"},{"eN_":"... (Bellows seems to be thinking about something)","key":"plotlanguage4010103"},{"eN_":"Bellows, do you know who that strange guy in the mask was just now?","key":"plotlanguage4010104"},{"eN_":"Well, he is the God of Nature.","key":"plotlanguage4010105"},{"eN_":"Ahhhhh! How annoying! I got sand in my eyes again!","key":"plotlanguage4010501"},{"eN_":"You guys! Stop!","key":"plotlanguage4010502"},{"eN_":"…?!","key":"plotlanguage4010503"},{"eN_":"Hand over anything of value on you!","key":"plotlanguage4010504"},{"eN_":"Heck!! Just in time! I'm so angry right now!","key":"plotlanguage4010505"},{"eN_":"Sia, don't hurt them!","key":"plotlanguage4010506"},{"eN_":"Do you know who we are? You're dead meat! Let go of us now!","key":"plotlanguage4011001"},{"eN_":"Huh? Who are you guys? By the way, what is this place?","key":"plotlanguage4011002"},{"eN_":"Hmph! You don't even know this place?! This is the Sighing Desert! We're with the Wind Dragon Mercenaries! Let us go now! Or you'll...","key":"plotlanguage4011003"},{"eN_":"There! You've already said the rest! (Sia knocks the bandit out with the hilt of her sword)","key":"plotlanguage4011004"},{"eN_":"There's something up ahead! Go check it out! (a group of people coming towards here in the distance)","key":"plotlanguage4011005"},{"eN_":"Here comes another one!","key":"plotlanguage4011006"},{"eN_":"What a great fight!","key":"plotlanguage4020101"},{"eN_":"I advise you to let us go quickly! Otherwise, you won't be able to escape when our troops come!","key":"plotlanguage4020102"},{"eN_":"I would like to ask, what is your reason for entering the Desert of Sighs with such a great effort?","key":"plotlanguage4020103"},{"eN_":"You guys don't have to pretend. You also came here to find the Fountain of Eternity, didn't you?","key":"plotlanguage4020104"},{"eN_":"The Fountain of Eternity?!","key":"plotlanguage4020105"},{"eN_":"You guys, stop talking! With my binoculars, I see a lot of people coming from afar!","key":"plotlanguage4020106"},{"eN_":"Phew... These guys are even tougher to deal with! Hey! Aren't you coming to help?","key":"plotlanguage4021001"},{"eN_":"Huh?! Me? Let's talk it over. Don't fight.","key":"plotlanguage4021002"},{"eN_":"Hmph! Do you think there's room for conversation?","key":"plotlanguage4021003"},{"eN_":"Hmph! Kill them!","key":"plotlanguage4021004"},{"eN_":"Captain! Word has come from the northwest. A strange woman has been sighted! She doesn't seem to be human and she has killed quite a few of us. Third Captain requests backup!","key":"plotlanguage4030101"},{"eN_":"What have we not seen in the Sighing Desert? There's nothing to worry about! Let me take care of these guys first!","key":"plotlanguage4030102"},{"eN_":"You're from Byanis?!","key":"plotlanguage4031001"},{"eN_":"I am Grand Duchess Bellows of Byanis, the current head of the Shield of Glory family.","key":"plotlanguage4031002"},{"eN_":"Hmph! Since that's the case, there's even more reason to not let you walk out of this desert alive!","key":"plotlanguage4031003"},{"eN_":"Ahem...","key":"plotlanguage4040101"},{"eN_":"Sia, you're hurt!","key":"plotlanguage4040102"},{"eN_":"It's okay, it's just a small injury, ahem.","key":"plotlanguage4040103"},{"eN_":"It's my fault. I shouldn't have been too kind.","key":"plotlanguage4040104"},{"eN_":"It's not your fault, ahem ahem ahem. I can only say that I'm not strong enough!","key":"plotlanguage4040105"},{"eN_":"Jessica, please take care of Sia while I go ahead and look for water.","key":"plotlanguage4040106"},{"eN_":"Oh, well, no trouble.","key":"plotlanguage4040107"},{"eN_":"What's going on?! Why is there such a strong smell of blood?","key":"plotlanguage4041001"},{"eN_":"Ah?! (After Bellows went over the sand, she saw bodies all over the ground, at least a few hundred of them, and all of them had just died recently)","key":"plotlanguage4041002"},{"eN_":"Save... Save me...","key":"plotlanguage4041003"},{"eN_":"There are survivors! (Bellows rushes over)","key":"plotlanguage4041004"},{"eN_":"Rip Rip Rip! (A huge sand worm burst out of the sand, swallowed the bandit in one gulp, and then looked at Bellows)","key":"plotlanguage4041005"},{"eN_":"Bellows! Are you all right?!","key":"plotlanguage4050101"},{"eN_":"Sia, what brings you here?","key":"plotlanguage4050102"},{"eN_":"I heard a lot of commotion and came over in this direction! Ahem.","key":"plotlanguage4050103"},{"eN_":"However, you are still injured.","key":"plotlanguage4050104"},{"eN_":"Whoa whoa whoa, are you a monster? You can still run so fast after being injured! Whew, I'm exhausted!","key":"plotlanguage4050105"},{"eN_":"Jessica, watch your back! (Bellows points in the direction behind Jessica. A bulging bag of sand dunes is rapidly approaching)","key":"plotlanguage4050106"},{"eN_":"Something's not right!","key":"plotlanguage4051001"},{"eN_":"What's wrong?","key":"plotlanguage4051002"},{"eN_":"These sandworms originally did not belong to the Desert of Sighs!","key":"plotlanguage4051003"},{"eN_":"These mercenaries should be very familiar with this desert. Not only can they confirm the location of their companions in such a large desert, but they can also pursue and surround the enemy.","key":"plotlanguage4051004"},{"eN_":"If there were such terrible creatures in the desert, they would have known about it.","key":"plotlanguage4051005"},{"eN_":"But judging from the terrified expressions on their faces, they probably didn't know these creatures were here, so...","key":"plotlanguage4051006"},{"eN_":"Good analysis, huh huh... Yes, they are all my children!","key":"plotlanguage4051007"},{"eN_":"Dinner's ready, boys and girls! (Just as he finished, a few more thresher emerged from the sand)","key":"plotlanguage4051008"},{"eN_":"Well, you have some capabilities, but you can't catch me! (After finishing the sentence, he flew away in the distance)","key":"plotlanguage4060101"},{"eN_":"Stop!","key":"plotlanguage4060102"},{"eN_":"Sia, wait a minute. She's trying to lure us to a more dangerous place! The same way she lured these mercenaries. (Bellows looks back at the dead mercenaries)","key":"plotlanguage4060103"},{"eN_":"This dune is just one of her hatcheries, and because of the timing, these sandworms are still in their juvenile stage.","key":"plotlanguage4060104"},{"eN_":"Huh? You mean, we'll encounter bigger bugs down here?","key":"plotlanguage4060105"},{"eN_":"Yes, and she fled in the direction of more powerful magic fluctuations, perhaps the direction of the Fountain of Eternity.","key":"plotlanguage4060106"},{"eN_":"Huh?! That's terrible. Can we stop looking?","key":"plotlanguage4060107"},{"eN_":"Coward, then you stay here while Bellows and I keep going!","key":"plotlanguage4060108"},{"eN_":"Whew, how can two beautiful women lack an escort? Hey, wait for me! (Jessica looked at Sia and Bellows, who were already far away, and hurriedly chased after them)","key":"plotlanguage4060109"},{"eN_":"Hmph... Should I say you guys are confident or stupid? You guys actually came along.","key":"plotlanguage4061001"},{"eN_":"You've killed so many people! Regardless of who you are, I will stop you!","key":"plotlanguage4061002"},{"eN_":"Oh, are you talking about those mercenaries? Ooh, ooh, ooh! Weren't they after you? I helped you get rid of them, so you should thank me!","key":"plotlanguage4061003"},{"eN_":"This woman, no! The sound of this bug is creeping me out!","key":"plotlanguage4061004"},{"eN_":"In return, you will be my children's dinner! (With these words, countless giant sandworms burst out of the sand and appeared in front of Bellows)","key":"plotlanguage4061005"},{"eN_":"Damn! This damn bug is really unusually big!","key":"plotlanguage4061006"},{"eN_":"You guys, get out of here!","key":"plotlanguage4070101"},{"eN_":"Humph! If we want to go, let's go together!","key":"plotlanguage4070102"},{"eN_":"You're really stubborn!","key":"plotlanguage4070103"},{"eN_":"I advise you not to resist! (Dinoen looked at Bellows and the others, who were covered in wounds, and stretched leisurely)","key":"plotlanguage4071001"},{"eN_":"Hmph! (A huge magic arrow shot through the sky towards the Thorny Insect Queen)","key":"plotlanguage4071002"},{"eN_":"?!","key":"plotlanguage4071003"},{"eN_":"Hmph! You're lucky! This isn't going to end like that! Uh... Ah! (Half of the Thorny Insect Queen's body flew out with a scream)","key":"plotlanguage4080101"},{"eN_":"How noisy! (Guha touches the blood on the scythe and puts it in her mouth to taste it)","key":"plotlanguage4080102"},{"eN_":"Hmm?! (Bellows covers her mouth with her hand and tries not to make a sound)","key":"plotlanguage4080103"},{"eN_":"Watch out! This fellow is strong! (Nadore subconsciously lowers the volume of her voice)","key":"plotlanguage4080104"},{"eN_":"Yuck! This worm's blood tastes awful! (Guha frowned slightly)","key":"plotlanguage4080105"},{"eN_":"But this bug reminds me! The Fountain of Eternity is indeed the best nourishment for raising children (Guha said and turned to a place in the West)","key":"plotlanguage4080106"},{"eN_":"The Fountain of Eternity?! (Bellows followed Guha's gaze)","key":"plotlanguage4080107"},{"eN_":"Come out! My child! (Guha raises her right hand high and plunges it into the sand with black magic)","key":"plotlanguage4080108"},{"eN_":"Roar! (Countless ghost soldiers burst out of the sand, like an army)","key":"plotlanguage4080109"},{"eN_":"You guys, get out of here!","key":"plotlanguage4081001"},{"eN_":"Nadore!!","key":"plotlanguage4081002"},{"eN_":"Don't worry! I have the blessing of the God of Nature. These evil things can't hurt me!","key":"plotlanguage4081003"},{"eN_":"You guys should walk to the east... (Nadore took a deep breath and continued) Cross the magic ridge and you will find the legendary Divine Ruins. Once there, you will be safe!","key":"plotlanguage4081004"},{"eN_":"Ho ho!!","key":"plotlanguage4081005"},{"eN_":"I can feel the powerful magic fluctuation here. This should be the magic ridge that Nadore mentioned!","key":"plotlanguage5010101"},{"eN_":"It's finally safe!","key":"plotlanguage5010102"},{"eN_":"OK! Let's take a break then.","key":"plotlanguage5010103"},{"eN_":"Hey, hey, hey, I think something is wrong. That strange totem over there is moving!","key":"plotlanguage5010104"},{"eN_":"Why do you have such little guts... Ah?! It's really moving!","key":"plotlanguage5010105"},{"eN_":"Oh no, we're caught! Then please accept my gift to you! (With that, he threw some strange totems at them)","key":"plotlanguage5010106"},{"eN_":"Watch out!","key":"plotlanguage5010107"},{"eN_":"Too bad she got away! But... I'm sure she's a girl! (Jessica shows a lewd smile)","key":"plotlanguage5010501"},{"eN_":"Hey, hey, hey, that's enough! (Sia shows an expression of contempt)","key":"plotlanguage5010502"},{"eN_":"Judging from her costume and tattoos, I think she's one of the barbarians living in the Magic Ridge!","key":"plotlanguage5010503"},{"eN_":"Barbarians? How come I've never heard of them?","key":"plotlanguage5010504"},{"eN_":"Well, they believe in the ten-winged sacred phoenix that was sacrificed in the ancient battle of creation. (Speaking of which, Bellows folded her hands)","key":"plotlanguage5010505"},{"eN_":"Coo-coo!! (Pico shoots a poison dart at Sia from the shadows)","key":"plotlanguage5010506"},{"eN_":"Huh! (Sia falls down and passes out after being hit by the dart)","key":"plotlanguage5010507"},{"eN_":"Damn, it's so densely wooded. There's no sign of them at all!","key":"plotlanguage5011001"},{"eN_":"The terrain here is not good for us! We need to find an open area!","key":"plotlanguage5011002"},{"eN_":"There is a river here. Let's clean Sia's wounds first!","key":"plotlanguage5011003"},{"eN_":"Hey! You guys, get out of here! You're polluting the water here! Oooh, the river gods will blame me! (Vicky rushes forward with her big pincers)","key":"plotlanguage5011004"},{"eN_":"What the hell is this place? How come crabs can talk too?!","key":"plotlanguage5020101"},{"eN_":"In this world, any living creature is spiritual, and many animals are stronger and smarter than humans, so... Ah!! (Before Bellows could finish her sentence, she was hoisted into the sky by a net)","key":"plotlanguage5020102"},{"eN_":"I got it! Gotcha!","key":"plotlanguage5020103"},{"eN_":"Ugh! It's humans again! Worthless! But... Hmph, there's a half-dragon there! Hm! It should be worth quite a bit of money!","key":"plotlanguage5020104"},{"eN_":"Uh... The metal box. What race are you? (Parker cocks his head in confusion)","key":"plotlanguage5020105"},{"eN_":"Iron box?! Don't look down on people, you little runt! Take one of my shots!","key":"plotlanguage5020106"},{"eN_":"How come the people here are so strong?! Even this little guy took me so much effort! (Jessica keeps tapping the smoking mechanical arm)","key":"plotlanguage5021001"},{"eN_":"It should be related to the terrain here. The magic atmosphere is strong here, and after living here for a long time, the physique will change.","key":"plotlanguage5021002"},{"eN_":"I can't smell the magic scent, but I can smell the smell of barbecue ~ (Jessica walked in the direction where the smell came from)","key":"plotlanguage5021003"},{"eN_":"Something doesn't smell right about this! Jessica! (Bellows tries to call out to Jessica, but unfortunately, it's too late)","key":"plotlanguage5021004"},{"eN_":"Huh? How remarkable that someone can resist the scent of my grilled meat.","key":"plotlanguage5030101"},{"eN_":"Jessica! (Bellows shakes the unconscious Jessica)","key":"plotlanguage5030102"},{"eN_":"It's useless! He will die in contentment!","key":"plotlanguage5030103"},{"eN_":"Damn!","key":"plotlanguage5030104"},{"eN_":"Stop it! You wretched creature! You've destroyed the precious Mancibetas I planted!","key":"plotlanguage5031001"},{"eN_":"Hmph! I knew it was the smell of these flowers that was weird! (Bellows steps back and gives Jessica a kick with her foot)","key":"plotlanguage5031002"},{"eN_":"(semi-comatose) Um... uh... is there more food on the menu? I... I can't... I can't eat anymore... hiccup!","key":"plotlanguage5031003"},{"eN_":"If you don't wake up, you'll become someone else's food! (kicks Jessica hard)","key":"plotlanguage5031004"},{"eN_":"Aah! Mmm. (Jessica sits up violently)","key":"plotlanguage5031005"},{"eN_":"Hmph! So what if you wake up? I'll cut you down just the same! (Throws the axe at Jessica, who is still not fully awake)","key":"plotlanguage5031006"},{"eN_":"Bellows says, \"Jessica! Look out!\"","key":"plotlanguage5031007"},{"eN_":"Well, what should we do? Sia is unconscious, and Jessica is seriously injured! (Bellows keeps using the holy light to heal Sia and Jessica)","key":"plotlanguage5040101"},{"eN_":"Damn it! My healing spells are no longer very effective! (Bellows has fainted due to her mana exhaustion)","key":"plotlanguage5040102"},{"eN_":"After an unknown period of time... It started to rain...","key":"plotlanguage5040103"},{"eN_":"Bellows! Wake up!","key":"plotlanguage5040104"},{"eN_":"Uh... It's raining... Sia! How about your wound?","key":"plotlanguage5040105"},{"eN_":"I don't know what happened. I'm all healed up! Jessica recovered too, and he went looking for food!","key":"plotlanguage5040106"},{"eN_":"What is going on? It's... It's not just any rain! (Bellows takes a deep breath)","key":"plotlanguage5040107"},{"eN_":"Hahahahaha, kid, you are indeed quite perceptive! (this sound comes from deep in the forest)","key":"plotlanguage5040108"},{"eN_":"Who is it?","key":"plotlanguage5040109"},{"eN_":"I am the River God. Come, follow the direction of the sound to find me!","key":"plotlanguage5040110"},{"eN_":"The grass is getting denser here! (Sia plucks the grass in front of her with difficulty)","key":"plotlanguage5041001"},{"eN_":"Phew... If only I had my flying machine. Ugh!","key":"plotlanguage5041002"},{"eN_":"Pike! (The barbarian totem attacked a line of people)","key":"plotlanguage5041003"},{"eN_":"Watch out!","key":"plotlanguage5041004"},{"eN_":"It's the little girl we met at the entrance to the magic ridge!","key":"plotlanguage5050101"},{"eN_":"It's you guys again!","key":"plotlanguage5050102"},{"eN_":"Uh... These flowers are disgusting!","key":"plotlanguage5050103"},{"eN_":"Since you dared to step into my garden, you can stay here and play with me! (Paigeen started to dance, and Cuckoo Flower started to attack Bellows and the others like a demon)","key":"plotlanguage5050104"},{"eN_":"You!! How dare you guys destroy all my flowers? Sob...","key":"plotlanguage5051001"},{"eN_":"What kind of fetish does this girl have? She likes this kind of flower?!","key":"plotlanguage5051002"},{"eN_":"Damn you! How dare you bully a girl! I'm not happy today, so I'll take it out on you! (Parker fiddles with his mask as he walks)","key":"plotlanguage5051003"},{"eN_":"Ah! It's you guys! (Parker straightens his mask and gasps)","key":"plotlanguage5051004"},{"eN_":"Pico is not afraid of them! (He said and spat a poisoned dart at them)","key":"plotlanguage5051005"},{"eN_":"Great! You guys are all here! (Sia looks at the tied up people and curses)","key":"plotlanguage5060101"},{"eN_":"Especially you! How dare you backstab me! (Sia kicked Pico hard)","key":"plotlanguage5060102"},{"eN_":"Ah! Don't be so arrogant! The Sky God will punish you!","key":"plotlanguage5060103"},{"eN_":"But didn't the Sky God and the Lord Chief go in search of the Divine Ruins, they shouldn't be at the Magic Ridge right now! (Parker speaks straightforwardly)","key":"plotlanguage5060104"},{"eN_":"...","key":"plotlanguage5060105"},{"eN_":"The River God will teach you a lesson for us!","key":"plotlanguage5060106"},{"eN_":"The River God is very nice. He won't get physical!","key":"plotlanguage5060107"},{"eN_":"Hey! Who the hell are you helping? (Pico spits at Parker in anger)","key":"plotlanguage5060108"},{"eN_":"Watch out! It's that smell again. Cover your nose!","key":"plotlanguage5060109"},{"eN_":"The same trick won't work on us anymore!","key":"plotlanguage5061001"},{"eN_":"I didn't come alone this time!","key":"plotlanguage5061002"},{"eN_":"?! (A huge figure descends from the sky. Bellows and the others black out)","key":"plotlanguage5061003"},{"eN_":"Watch them now! (Melky leaps up with ease and instantly disappears into the mountains)","key":"plotlanguage5070101"},{"eN_":"Yes, my lord! (Roch nods to the back of the Mountain Top God)","key":"plotlanguage5070102"},{"eN_":"Pico, Parker, you guys keep an eye on these guys. I'm going to take a break! (Roch said with a high-spirited voice)","key":"plotlanguage5070103"},{"eN_":"Yes... (Before he finished, Pico, Parker and Roch all passed out)","key":"plotlanguage5070104"},{"eN_":"Uh...?","key":"plotlanguage5070105"},{"eN_":"Kids...","key":"plotlanguage5070106"},{"eN_":"This voice is the voice of... The River God?","key":"plotlanguage5070107"},{"eN_":"Heh heh heh, come on, follow my voice. (The voice of the River God fades away)","key":"plotlanguage5070108"},{"eN_":"Senior! What's wrong with you? (Bellows looked at Rojka, who was chained to the stone pillar, and said)","key":"plotlanguage5071001"},{"eN_":"Come closer Bellows. Let me take a good look at you. (The River God slowly lifts his head)","key":"plotlanguage5071002"},{"eN_":"You know me? (Bellows crouches down and puts herself as much as possible at eye level with the River God)","key":"plotlanguage5071003"},{"eN_":"Good! How nice! As expected of a good child from the Norwich family.","key":"plotlanguage5071004"},{"eN_":"You are...","key":"plotlanguage5071005"},{"eN_":"My name is Rojka Norwich. The thirteenth patriarch of the Shield of Glory.","key":"plotlanguage5071006"},{"eN_":"You are the Lord Grandfather! Who locked you in here? (Bellows looks at the rusty chains on the River God's hands)","key":"plotlanguage5071007"},{"eN_":"Leave me alone... (Rojka took a deep breath) Good child, when you entered Magic Ridge, I felt your presence. I did not expect to see you again before I die. Ahem.","key":"plotlanguage5071008"},{"eN_":"Here, take this. It will lead you to the Divine Ruins.","key":"plotlanguage5071009"},{"eN_":"Do it! Make sure you get there before Jirawi and the others. (With that, Rojka closed his eyes forever)","key":"plotlanguage5071010"},{"eN_":"Hmph! Who gave you permission to barge in here?!","key":"plotlanguage5071011"},{"eN_":"Hmph! The power of the River God! Who are you people?","key":"plotlanguage5080101"},{"eN_":"He was my grandfather. (Bellows looks back at the dead Rojka)","key":"plotlanguage5080102"},{"eN_":"Since this is the case, there's even more reason to not let you walk out alive!","key":"plotlanguage5080103"},{"eN_":"Hmph! That old bastard's power isn't that easy to control, is it?!","key":"plotlanguage5081001"},{"eN_":"Hmph! (There was another shrill sound as a green magic arrow sliced across the sky)","key":"plotlanguage5081002"},{"eN_":"Nadore?! (Rafael yells out in disbelief)","key":"plotlanguage5081003"},{"eN_":"Rafael, so you've been hiding here!","key":"plotlanguage6010101"},{"eN_":"Nadore! I'll kill you! Uh... Ahem. (Rafael struggles to get to his feet)","key":"plotlanguage6010102"},{"eN_":"You guys know each other?","key":"plotlanguage6010103"},{"eN_":"He was originally one of the three elven archers, and was shot blind in one eye when I captured him for privately opening the boundary of the Blue Light Forest. After that, there was no news of him.","key":"plotlanguage6010104"},{"eN_":"Wakan, the God of the Wild, Fitz, the Sky God, and Jirawi, the Chief of the Five Tribal Gods, are not at the Magic Ridge; they should have already set out in search of the Divine Ruins. We have to hurry up!","key":"plotlanguage6010105"},{"eN_":"Hahaha, it's too late! Ahem!","key":"plotlanguage6010106"},{"eN_":"Wait a minute. Something doesn't feel right to me.","key":"plotlanguage6010501"},{"eN_":"What's wrong?","key":"plotlanguage6010502"},{"eN_":"It seems we've been down this road before!","key":"plotlanguage6010503"},{"eN_":"Ah! Don't scare me. Did we get lost again?","key":"plotlanguage6010504"},{"eN_":"This is a kind of magic boundary, as long as you find the stone guarding the boundary, you can open the boundary. (Nadore closed her eyes seems to be sensing something)","key":"plotlanguage6010505"},{"eN_":"So how do we find the stone that guards the boundary?","key":"plotlanguage6010506"},{"eN_":"Follow me! This way! (Nadore's eyes open)","key":"plotlanguage6010507"},{"eN_":"Looks like we're too late. Someone has already crossed the boundary! (Nadore said while looking at the shards of illusion stones on the ground)","key":"plotlanguage6011001"},{"eN_":"Could it be...","key":"plotlanguage6011002"},{"eN_":"It's Jirawi and the Tribal Gods!

(throws a boulder towards the crowd)","key":"plotlanguage6020102"},{"eN_":"Watch out!

(Sia flies over and catches Bellows)","key":"plotlanguage6020104"},{"eN_":"So Jirawi is talking about you little suckers!","key":"plotlanguage6020105"},{"eN_":"I spared your lives at the Magic Ridge, but I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful as to follow me here!","key":"plotlanguage6020106"},{"eN_":"Sia, you take Bellows and go first.

(Nadore said while looking at the unconscious Bellows in Sia's arms)","key":"plotlanguage6020107"},{"eN_":"Heck, none of you are going anywhere!","key":"plotlanguage6020108"},{"eN_":"No! Jessica! Help me take care of Bellows. I'm going back to help Nadore!","key":"plotlanguage6021001"},{"eN_":"Ah! Hey! Don't be impulsive! If Nadore can't handle him, you're just going to get yourself killed!","key":"plotlanguage6021002"},{"eN_":"Sia! (Bellows sits up violently and grabs Sia's arm)","key":"plotlanguage6021003"},{"eN_":"Bellows! What happened to you? You're so badly injured! (Sia says and keeps touching Bellows' body)","key":"plotlanguage6021004"},{"eN_":"It's okay! I'm fine. It was the power of the River God that helped me recover.","key":"plotlanguage6021005"},{"eN_":"Come on, let's go back and help Nadore!","key":"plotlanguage6021006"},{"eN_":"Hmph! I can't believe that Rafael would lose to a loser like you! (Melky looks at Nadore, who is lying on the ground and says)","key":"plotlanguage6030101"},{"eN_":"Ahem, looks like I'm not very fit to fight alone after all! (Nadore struggles to stand up)","key":"plotlanguage6030102"},{"eN_":"Then I will send you off on your way! (Suddenly, the sky glowed so brightly that Melky hastily covered his eyes with his hand)","key":"plotlanguage6030103"},{"eN_":"Justice has come forth. Evil is scattered! (Bellows descends from the sky as a golden light)","key":"plotlanguage6030104"},{"eN_":"Bellows?! How is it possible?! My power is returning (Nadore looks at the light shining on his body)","key":"plotlanguage6030105"},{"eN_":"It's time to end it! (Nadore aims his bow at Melky)","key":"plotlanguage6030106"},{"eN_":"Watch out, something is amiss ahead!","key":"plotlanguage6031001"},{"eN_":"This... (Sia can't help but look at the corpses all over the ground and gaped)","key":"plotlanguage6031002"},{"eN_":"All the power in these people has been stripped away! Only their corpses remain!","key":"plotlanguage6031003"},{"eN_":"They're right here at the top of the altar! (Nadore takes a deep breath)","key":"plotlanguage6031004"},{"eN_":"Where is your great priestess? Here I am again! (Jirawi said with an impatient snort)","key":"plotlanguage6040101"},{"eN_":"Hmph! (Goya palms at Jirawi's position and Jirawi instantly turns into a huge block of ice)","key":"plotlanguage6040102"},{"eN_":"How do you two want to die? (Fisch says to Wakan and Fez, who were behind Jirawi)","key":"plotlanguage6040103"},{"eN_":"What? (but Fez scratched his head indifferently, as if the matter of Jirawi being frozen had nothing to do with him)","key":"plotlanguage6040104"},{"eN_":"The eye of the storm! (Fisch's clasped upper hand snapped open and a huge tornado engulfed the three of them directly)","key":"plotlanguage6040105"},{"eN_":"Ho! (A huge energy burst out from the eye of the storm. The ice, as well as the storm, disappeared with this loud bang)","key":"plotlanguage6040106"},{"eN_":"Is this what you call Elle magic? It's been so long, but you still haven't made any progress! Well, if you guys want to fight so much, bring it on!","key":"plotlanguage6040107"},{"eN_":"Damn! This guy is so strong!","key":"plotlanguage6041001"},{"eN_":"No, no, no! You guys are the ones who are too weak. I haven't even broken a sweat yet!","key":"plotlanguage6041002"},{"eN_":"Stop!","key":"plotlanguage6041003"},{"eN_":"Oh? Looks like Mei couldn't stop you guys, huh? (Jirawi turned his head in confusion)","key":"plotlanguage6041004"},{"eN_":"But in that case, you'll be my audience! (Jirawi's eyes look towards the entrance of the temple)","key":"plotlanguage6041005"},{"eN_":"It's been a long time since I've been able to move my muscles! (Randall walks out of the temple with Lyanna)","key":"plotlanguage6041006"},{"eN_":"Haha, the impressive one has finally come out. Why didn't you do so earlier?","key":"plotlanguage6041007"},{"eN_":"Randall! Watch out.","key":"plotlanguage6041008"},{"eN_":"Hahahaha, it feels amazing! (Jirawi wipes the blood from the corner of his mouth and says)","key":"plotlanguage6050101"},{"eN_":"It's time for you to see the power of the Holy Emperor! (The earth suddenly trembles violently and a huge figure appears from behind Jirawi)","key":"plotlanguage6050102"},{"eN_":"No! (Lyanna's eyes suddenly widen)","key":"plotlanguage6050103"},{"eN_":"Hmph! (Randall's body also shines with a multicolored glow)","key":"plotlanguage6050104"},{"eN_":"We have to stop Jirawi! Her power will destroy the entire temple!","key":"plotlanguage6051001"},{"eN_":"Are you crazy?! What can we do in front of such a powerful force? Let's just run first!","key":"plotlanguage6051002"},{"eN_":"You just know how to run! Bellows, I'll go with you!","key":"plotlanguage6051003"},{"eN_":"I knew you wouldn't be good spectators! You're better suited to be dead! (As soon as these words were spoken, Fez's scythe appeared around Bellows' neck)","key":"plotlanguage6051004"},{"eN_":"This can't be! (Fez was sent flying by a golden light)","key":"plotlanguage6060101"},{"eN_":"Huh?! (Wakan was also shocked by this sudden scene)","key":"plotlanguage6060102"},{"eN_":"What? (Lyanna was also shocked by this scene and had an incredulous look on her face)","key":"plotlanguage6060103"},{"eN_":"No wonder Melky didn't finish you off! However, all magic is ineffective against me! (Wakan slowly walks towards Bellows)","key":"plotlanguage6060104"},{"eN_":"Haha, the five-colored phosphorescence is only so-so! (Jirawi looked at Randall, who was dying at his feet, and said)","key":"plotlanguage6061001"},{"eN_":"I still have some unfinished business today! I'm not going to play with you (Jirawi smiles and looks at Lyanna)","key":"plotlanguage6061002"},{"eN_":"High Priestess! If you had promised me earlier to help me resurrect the Holy Emperor, you wouldn't be in this situation today!","key":"plotlanguage6070101"},{"eN_":"Jirawi, what you are bearing is not the power of the Holy Emperor at all!","key":"plotlanguage6070102"},{"eN_":"Hmph! You despicable Elaians! The Holy Emperor was willing to fight for you, but you sealed his body in the void!","key":"plotlanguage6070103"},{"eN_":"Who told you this?!","key":"plotlanguage6070104"},{"eN_":"The Spirit of the Holy Emperor was passed on to me and I speak to him every day! My father's generation is weak and impotent, but I am not!","key":"plotlanguage6070105"},{"eN_":"If you obediently surrender the Rune, I might be able to spare your life! Otherwise, your clan will be exterminated today!","key":"plotlanguage6070106"},{"eN_":"What?! Why can't your mana be swallowed?!","key":"plotlanguage6071001"},{"eN_":"Could it be that you are using the power of Runes?!","key":"plotlanguage6071002"},{"eN_":"Aah! (Wakan's scream attracts Jirawi's attention)","key":"plotlanguage6080101"},{"eN_":"Hmph! What a bunch of losers. They can't even handle a bunch of mice. I have to do everything myself!","key":"plotlanguage6080102"},{"eN_":"Bellows, look out!","key":"plotlanguage6080103"},{"eN_":"You pesky little rats, die! (Jirawi's body glows brightly, and the golden light is mixed with black smoke)","key":"plotlanguage6080104"},{"eN_":"Ah! (In the face of Jirawi's attack, the Runes on Bellows' body suddenly glowed even brighter, making the already darkened sky as white as day)","key":"plotlanguage6080105"},{"eN_":"The Goddess Clan?! (Lyanna throws her red Rune at Bellows, and it merges with Bellows' golden one)","key":"plotlanguage6080106"},{"eN_":"What?! (Jirawi was instantly overwhelmed by this orange glow, and the black mist on Jirawi's body dissipated)","key":"plotlanguage6080107"},{"eN_":"Randall! (Lyanna cried as she hugged Randall's body.)","key":"plotlanguage6081001"},{"eN_":"Bellows! The Apostles have invaded this planet. Since you are the descendant of the Goddess Clan, complete this last mission for me! I will let Randall watch over you together!","key":"plotlanguage6081002"},{"eN_":"The Call of Fate!
